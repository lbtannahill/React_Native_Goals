## What I learned

This was a great intro to React Native. It was a good refresher for react state, and allowed me to learn some of the basic React Native components. I really enjoyed setting up the emulators as well and being able to see the app in live time. This is a phenomenal tutoral, and anyone looking to learn React Native should take it.
